### What's Up ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Daniel aka LeDaniii. I am an Automation technician usally travelling arround the world to lead assembly teams.
Covid gave me the opportunity to get educational leave for enrolling into a coding bootcamp named CodeFactory.
I am doing this because i have some idias for my workspace but sadly software is often too expensive for a middle-sized company.
So I decided to do this by my own.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a management-hub for special machine assembly.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning literally everything.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on everything :)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with javascript, flutter and serversite languages.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Special machine assembly, electric motors, automation.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: danielmatzer@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Him/his....honestly don't care
- âš¡ Fun fact: programming is like speacial machine assembly, you put parts together and if something is going wrong it will be a absolutely shi-show XD

**15+ years building machines** that could probably outlive us all. From precision welding to commissioning production lines across three continents. Heavy industries taught me how to build things right. Now I'm applying that to software.

**3+ years as a developer** still not sure what breaks more often: my code or the machines I used to build. At least a `NullReferenceException` has a stack trace. A measurement machine that drifts 0.02mm because someone sneezed near it? Good luck debugging that.

Specializing in **SCADA systems, industrial automation, and software that doesn't crumble under pressure**, because I've seen what happens when things crumble under pressure. Usually sparks are involved.

### What I Work With

**`Craftsman | Developer | Hyperlapse Film Maker | Machine Builder`**

**Domain:** Industrial Automation · SCADA · MES · Manufacturing Quality Control

### Currently Building

**[Project Eros](https://github.com/LeDaniii/Eros)** a high-performance real-time charting library. WebGPU rendering, SharedArrayBuffer ring buffers, WebWorkers per channel. Built to visualize 1M+ data points at 60fps because existing charting libraries tap out way before that.

**[Gargantua](https://github.com/LeDaniii/Gargantua)** a vendor-agnostic translation layer between industrial PLCs and REST APIs. Hides S7, ADS, EtherNet/IP behind a single interface so your SCADA, MES, or analytics tool doesn't need to care what PLC it's talking to. Basically an interpreter for machines that refuse to speak the same language.

**Assembler App** a manufacturing execution tool for multi-site assembly operations. Digital checklists, audit trails, AI-powered translation. Waiting in line behind the other two

👨‍💻 From assembling machines that could probably outlive us all to crafting code that’s just as reliable. 15+ years in the automotive and heavy industries taught me how to build things right, now I’m applying that to software. <br>
💻 Switched gears 3 years ago to become a programmer, specializing in SCADA systems, automation, and software that doesn’t crumble under pressure. <br>
📚 Always learning, because solving complex problems is just a fancy way of saying, “Why not make life easier for everyone?” <br>
🎯 Obsessed with creating future proof tools that actually help people, because who needs more useless apps? <br>
🌍 Based in Austria, where the Schnitzels are oversized, the mountains are steep, and my pull requests are as dangerous as Arnold Schwarzenegger himself.
